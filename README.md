### Hi thereüëã

Welcome to my **GitHub** profile, I am **Mohit Kumar** and I am an enthusiastic consumer of knowledge, highly impassioned for cutting edge technologies and research, and deeply motivated to apply my skills in the real-life project which can impact people.ü§©‚úåÔ∏è

My current learning and project explorations are in these domains:

‚Ä¢	 **Quantum Computing & Quantum Information Science.**

‚Ä¢	**Artificial Intelligence**- Reinforcement Learning (RL), Deep RL, AI at Edge.

‚Ä¢	**Machine Learning**- Statistical Machine Learning techniques and Algorithms.

‚Ä¢	**Data Science**- Data Mining, Data Analysis, Predictive Modelling.

‚Ä¢	**Deep Learning**- ANN, CNN, RNN, Auto Encoders.

‚Ä¢	**Computer Vision**- Color Vision & Visual Recognition.

From small solo projects to production level creative collaborations in my most pertinent skills, I have always looked for the chance to explore new venues and learn something new that I can apply to my work. I firmly believe that hard work eventually pays off, and I know that each day brings me closer to reaching my goals.
